# Samla's Toolbox
Educational application for Motala Museum

The purpose of this game is to let children explore and learn about tools used in the Stone Age, together with the museum’s mascot, the bird Samla.

## About this project
This project is built with React and Vite.  
I illustrated all the tools and the background in Procreate.

Please note: this project is not responsive, as it was intended to run on a specific display at the museum.

## Upcoming Features
- More illustrations of Stone Age tools  
- The museum’s mascot, Samla the bird, will provide simple information about each tool when clicked
